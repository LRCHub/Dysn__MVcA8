Sometimes my weakness still surprises me
I try to fight it but the pussy mesmerizes me
I ain't even worried 'bout how tight it be
Don't know what I'm doing, if it's wrong or if it's right of me
I get so excited b
Every time a cutie's saying hi to me
I ain't trying to lie to her
I lie to me
Guess that that's the irony
Nontheless I'm tireless entirely
Now she thinks she needs a tire iron and an eye on me
Time to face my mommy issues finally
Time to take the oil to the refinery
She'd be always rolling eyes and sighing at the sight of me
She was always fighting me
Got all in my psyche
Ever since it seems the thought of being alone has always frightened me
To the point that people used to liken me
To some type of player
But I wasn't playing
I was always praying she'd be staying
All of those erections and different directions I'd be swaying
Had me feeling like a phony
One day I'm always calling her, calling her tenderoni
Next day I'm feeling lonely
See I ain't never give these women time to be my homey
I's busy tryna take em home, I need someone to hold me
I never took the time to let em show me
I's all for moving forward wit the unknown till I found out they didn't know me
My heart was those degrees below
That shit was all bologna
I wanted that Maria meeting Tony
But now I'm all alone and steady on the bone and got no one to blow me
I got no one and got no one and only
And luckily I'm in the zone with writing songs 'cause time be moving slowly
Without no one to ride the pole or want to ride the pony
I'm also into cuddling
But I'm never cool just being the hunk, I'm always trying to be the husband
Yo it be just a couple pumps I'm tryna call her pumpkin
I always knew that I was up to something
Yo look all in my file, my whole style been denial and delusion
I wanted the illusion
I'd speak on future, that shit would confuse em, I was using em
Figured since I usually was choosy when I was choosing em
Found em then I frowned on the notion of ever losing em
I became a loser tho
Saying all the right things for the wrong reasons
Thought I's honest so my conscious and conversations were clear
But entire situations my motivation was fear
Currently my motivation is willingness to evolve
Hear the voices, I don't listen, I've discipline and resolve
There's no need to answer yes to every single invitation
Had enough of playing doctor
Time to play some operation
More preciser mouvements
Less the oscillation
More procrastination
Less the proclamations
Less the oscillation
This is something that I owe to myself
One to grow with's the goal of taking a hold of myself
I don't know
How that's gonna go
But it's gotta go
Hot or cold yo I'ma hold on tight and go Geronimo
Not opposed to trying to be adult and try a new approach
And am quite excited at the prospect of some new results
Get my head right 'stead of always tryna poke
Get my heart right while it still has got a pulse
'Fore it's broke
Get the venom and the sickness out my system
'Fore I find another victim
Only one that's even truly on my wish list is my wisdom
So I'm off my shit and on to right my ship and keep it steady
When I meet her I'll be ready
If we haven't met already
Take a rest and rescue me
Acting like a refugee
Which has been my specialty
But the truth shall set me free
I be fishy as a fisherman with fishes in the sea
But now the hydra's slain
I'm hydroplaning plain as you can see
And won't ruin for someone to spoon with soon as I can't sleep
Now I'm off to make the ladies swoon as soon as I can be
Peace
